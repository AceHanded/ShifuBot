## Description

Multifunctional Discord bot implementation using Python, with emphasis on music commands.

ShifuBot has been in development for a few years now, and has come a long way since the beginning. It is absolutely not perfect, although the current version seems to be fairly stable. I will keep updating the bot irregularly when I can think of improvements, and when I feel like it.

**Note:** I will most likely not be releasing the bot itself for public use, at least not any time soon. However, I have included template files for the project, so you can run your own Discord bot using ShifuBot's code as a base. Simply remove the `.template` suffix from the `.env` file and add the values of the API keys / tokens to match your own, and you should be good to go.
